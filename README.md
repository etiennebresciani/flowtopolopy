# FlowTopoloPy

FlowTopoloPy ("Flow Topology Python") is a Python package to perform topology
and topology-based analyses of flow fields.

## Functionalities

* Extraction of the topological skeleton (i.e., critical points and
separatrices) of 2D and 3D flow fields.

* Topology-based segmentation of 2D flow fields.

* Computation of topology-based quantitative measures of 2D flow fields.

* Topology-aware automatic streamline seeding.
